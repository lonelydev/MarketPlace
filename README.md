# Hands on Domain Driven Design

This is a solution built while following the book [Hands-On Domain Driven Design with .NET Core: Tackling Complexity in the heart of software by putting DDD principles into practice](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07C5WSR9B/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).

Hoping to add some details to my blog and will cross reference code from this repository to make it a good learning experience.
